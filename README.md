Note: read README.txt vagrant directory before launch the application.
  
The application will launch in http://192.168.100.200:8080/
 
On the first login, it has to be used "admin" as user and "admin" as password.

The application has the next movies after start:
  - Interstellar
  - Deadpool
  - Back to the Future II

To search a movie with the search bar it has to be typed the exact movie title.

To modify an user or a movie, the mandatory form fields are "ID" and "Administrador" in case of the user. The empty form fields won't be modified.

When adding a film, the URL form field must be a link to a YouTube video with a relative path starting by "embed" (is the link shown in the src attribute when clicked in share video -> insert).

The administration option in the navbar appears only when the user has the administrator rol.
